Welcome ðŸ‘‹, I'm **Matthias**

I'm currenlty employed at [University Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en) as an ICT officer.
<br>My main goal is to didactically and technologically improve the courses, lectures and infrastructure for the master program of statistics and data science, CenStat, I-BioStat and DSI.
<br><br>
I love tech and like to explore and learn about various open-source technologies and projects. This website will mainly be use to track my career, experience and as a personal knowledge base.
