My name is Matthias Benaets, I currently reside in [Alken, Limburg, Belgium](https://www.google.be/maps/place/3570+Alken/@50.8795835,5.2603162,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c118c17acd03cf:0xba0a56b07a363d7f!8m2!3d50.8891784!4d5.306758).

I'm a certified Secondary Education Teacher specialised in IT/Computer Science, the English language and ICT Coordination.
Currently I work as ICT Officer at [University Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en).

I'm an avid cyclist, love the outdoors and enjoy wildlife photography. You can follow my adventure on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14868815) and view some of my images on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/142503919@N05/).<br>
At home I like to tinker with my homelab, self-hosting, open-source projects and containerisation.

> If I have to describe myself in a couple words: <br>
> enthusiastic &bull; teamplayer &bull; independent &bull; pragmatic &bull; deliberate &bull; creative &bull; meticulous &bull; positive
