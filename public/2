# Introduction

NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager.
The main reason for using NixOS is the declarative reproducability of your system.

NixOS allows you to declare pretty much everything about your system inside a single document. This document allows for the reproducable setup that can be used on any system.

Whenever this document gets updates, NixOS will generate a new generation which can be booted into. Since NixOS is known for being unbreakable, it will also store the previous generations just in case the new changes are causing issues.

Unlike the average Linux destribution, NixOS stores all it's packages inside the `/nix/store`
